# Project Name
**SettleCAN**

# Project Summary

**SettleCAN** is a centralized digital platform designed to support newcomers to Canada by providing clear, personalized, and step-by-step guidance for essential settlement tasks. The platform helps international students, temporary foreign workers, permanent residents, and other newcomers navigate tasks such as applying for a Social Insurance Number (SIN), opening a bank account, accessing healthcare, obtaining photo identification, and maintaining valid immigration status. Unlike existing solutions, **SettleCAN** consolidates official information from government sources into a single, user-friendly platform, offering dynamic checklists, reminders for critical deadlines, and tailored guidance based on the user’s immigration status. The goal of **SettleCAN** is to reduce confusion, prevent missed deadlines, and empower newcomers to settle confidently and efficiently in Canada.
