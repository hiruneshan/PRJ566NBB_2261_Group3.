### 6. Existing Solutions and Market Gaps
#### What exists
- Government Websites (IRCC, Service Canada): Authoritative but siloed, text-heavy, and not user-centric. They provide information but not personalized, actionable timelines.  
(IRCC  :https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html 
Service Canada: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html) 
- BorderPass(By Seneca College): Focuses on immigration eligibility and application processes (pre-arrival), not post-arrival settlement.  
(BorderPass. https://www.borderpass.ai/) 
- Canoo: Offers perks and discounts but not procedural guidance. 
(Canoo. https://canoo.ca/) 
- Community Forums & Social Media (e.g., Facebook Groups): Provide peer support but risk spreading outdated or incorrect information. 
Gap: A trusted, official, and action-oriented platform that holds a newcomer's hand from the moment they receive their approval letter through their first critical years.
